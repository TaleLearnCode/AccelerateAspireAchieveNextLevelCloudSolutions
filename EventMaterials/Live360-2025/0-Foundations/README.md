# Module 0: Foundations & Kickoff

In this module, we’ll establish the technical foundation for the workshop. You’ll configure Terraform remote state, deploy baseline infrastructure, and scaffold CI/CD pipelines. By the end, you’ll have a reproducible environment and an automated pipeline that we’ll expand in later modules.

## Learning Objectives
- Configure Terraform to use Azure Storage for remote state.
- Deploy baseline Azure resources (resource group, storage, Service Bus).
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.
- Run the pipeline and verify resources are provisioned.

## Labs
- [Lab 0.1 – Remote State](./Lab0.1-Remote-State/README.md)  
- [Lab 0.2 – Baseline Infrastructure](./Lab0.2-Baseline-Infrastructure/README.md)  
- [Lab 0.3 – CI/CD Setup](./Lab0.3-CICD-Setup/README.md)  
- [Lab 0.4 – Run and Verify](./Lab0.4-Run-and-Verify/README.md)  

## Next Steps
Once your environment is provisioned and pipelines run, you’ll be ready to build your first event-driven component in Module 1.
